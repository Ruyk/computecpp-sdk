Software Managed Virtual Pointer
================================

This folder contains the implementation of a software-managed virtual
pointer that facilitates a pointer interface for SYCL buffers.
This virtual address
space is non-dereferenceable on the host, but accessors can be obtained
in the SYCL command groups.

This differs from the legacy_pointer interface in that a contiguous
virtual address space of sizeof(size_t) bits is created. 
When allocating a buffer using *SYCLMalloc*, a virtual address in the
range of 1 to 2<sup>sizeof(size_t)<sup> is returned. 
This is, in practise, a number that identifies a certain SYCL buffer. 
The pointer can be offseted, so that positions inside a given buffer 
can be identified and passed around in higher-level functions.
This enables pointer arithmetic on the virtual addresses. 
From any virtual pointer address, the methods `get_buffer` and 
`get_offset` can always be used to retrieve the SYCL buffer associated with
it, together with the offset from the base address of the given buffer.

[source,cpp]

// Create the Pointer Mapper structure
PointerMapper pMap;
// Create a SYCL buffer of 10 floats
// This pointer is a number that identifies the buffer
// on the pointer mapper structure
float * a = static_cast<float *>(SYCLmalloc(10 * sizeof(float)), pMap);
// Create a SYCL buffer of 25 integers
int * b = static_cast<int *>(SYCLmalloc(25 * sizeof(int)), pMap);
// Create a pointer to the 5th element
// This simply adds 5 * sizeof(float *) to the base address.
float * c = a + 5; 
// Retrieve the buffer
assert(pMap.get_buffer(a) == pMap.get_buffer(c))
// Substracting the value of the offset from the base address of the
// buffer recovers the offset into it
assert(pMap.get_offset(c) == 5)

// Invalid usage: no-dereference on the host
// float myVal = *c;
// Valid access on host: Use host-accessor
{
  auto syclAcc = pMap.get_buffer(a).get_access<access::mode::read, 
                                              access::target::host_buffer>();
  float myVal = syclAcc[0];
}

// Free the pointers
SYCLfree(a);
SYCLfree(b);

Developers looking for a simple replacement of malloc/free functions should
use the Legacy Pointer interface.
In situations where developers need complete addressing of the entire
device memory space, developers should use this software-managed 
virtual pointer.

Note that multiple PointerMapper objects can be instantiated simultaneously.

Usage
-----

Include the _virtual_ptr_ header file in your program.
Replace your device malloc and free operations with *codeplay::SYCLmalloc*
and *codeplay::SYCLfree*.
These functions are not re-entrant, even thought the underlying SYCL 
buffer objects are thread-safe.

To retrieve the SYCL buffer from the virtual pointer, use the 
*codeplay::PointerMapper::get_buffer* function.
The offset into the SYCL buffer on the device side can be retrieved using the
*codeplay::PointerMapper::get_offset* function.

See the tests for basic usage examples.
Note that the pointer is non-dereferenceable on the host, but host accessors
can be constructed once the buffer is retrieved.
